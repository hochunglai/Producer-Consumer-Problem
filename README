==== Description ====
This is to implement the finite circular buffer for the producer and consumer problem by using Linux shared memory and semaphores.

==== Instructions to Use ====
Note:
------------------
Create two text documents beforehand with names, input_file.txt and output_file.txt, using the following two commands:
cat > input_file.txt
cat > output_file.txt

The producer process will read from a file. The file can only be named "input_file.txt". The consumer process will write to a file. The file can only be named "output_file.txt". 

An example input_file.txt is attached. The content can be changed.

First Terminal:
------------------
• This terminal is used to run an instance of the producer program
• Simply enter the command below to run an instance of it 
./producer


Second Terminal:
------------------
• This terminal is used to run an instance of the consumer program
• Simply enter the command below to run an instance of it
./consumer
